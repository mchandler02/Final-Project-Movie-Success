# Final-Project-Movie-Success
The Final Movie Success Project was created by Anthony Njuguna, Humera Anjum, Molly Sullivan and Rebecca Tricker. 

This final project involves Machine Learning models and techniques that have been learned through the University of Minnesota Data Analytics & Visualization Boot Camp. Through this project we are able to showcase the skills we have learned with Machine Learning along with additional programming languages like HTML. 

For our final project, we used the following dataset from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/gabrielegalimberti/movies-example-for-machine-learning-activities?select=MACHINE_LEARNING_FINAL.csv. 

We chose this dataset because it was designed for Machine Learning, had variables to use for our Machine Learning models, and included a rating integer variable that would determine the success or failure of a movie. The goal of this project was to determine if different variables such as release year, lifetime gross, rating count, movie duration, number of nominations and wins, and more could be used to determine the success or failure of a movie.

Using the movie data, we used five different models to predict a movie's success: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, SVM, and Neural Networks.
